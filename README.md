## Submission Data

* Notebook file has the linear regression analysis after the pair of graphs as requested

# VacationPy

*Output folder contains the png files for the heatmap and the hotel map
*Google Key was not provided in config file (as I did incorrectly the first time) so individual key will need to be input if desired
